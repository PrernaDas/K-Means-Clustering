# K-Means-Clustering - HW5-CS545 PSU
R code
K-means clustering algorithm to cluster and classify the OptDigits data, originally from the UCI ML repository.
Each instance has 64 attributes, each of which can have value 0 - 16.
K-means clustering algorithm is implemented using Eucledean distance and the resulting clusters are evaluated using sum-squared error, sum-squared separation and entropy.
